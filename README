check_carp (v0.1) by Kian Mohageri <kian.mohageri@gmail.com>

This plugin is intended for use with Nagios (http://nagios.org).

This plugin checks the state of a carp(4) interface.  If you don't
specify an expected state, the plugin just prints out the current 
state and returns OK.  If you specify an expected state, and the
current state is different, the plugin returns CRITICAL.

If there is a problem fetching the state information, the plugin
returns UNKNOWN.
